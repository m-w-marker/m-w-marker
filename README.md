# Hi, I'm Michael Marker

I build a Windows desktop app for authoring PBR materials and product scenes, plus the slim web
viewer that ships the result to customers. Both run the same engine, so a material looks identical
in the editor and on the customer's page. That constraint drives most of the decisions below.

- **Real-time viewport on WebGPU** (three.js `WebGPURenderer`) and an **offline path tracer** for
  final images: interactive preview, a render window with history and post, denoising via Intel
  Open Image Denoise.
- **Editor**: material library, presets, undo/redo, dockable panels, a project container, model
  import with real-world scale (glTF/FBX, STEP via OpenCascade).
- **Desktop shell in Rust** (Tauri/WebView2, where WebGPU does work), Windows installer.
- **No build step, one dependency.** The web viewer is plain ES modules and self-hosted three.js.
  Customers host it themselves and own their data.

Most of what shows up on this profile falls out of that work: minimal repros, measurement
harnesses, and bugs that turned out to be upstream's.

### Upstream

I file bugs against [three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js) and
[three-gpu-pathtracer](https://github.com/gkjohnson/three-gpu-pathtracer). Measured, not eyeballed:
a headless run on a real GPU, an error count with and without the patch, a live repro. The last one
went from 1771 errors to 0 and shipped in r186. Not every report lands.
[All of them.](https://github.com/search?q=author%3Am-w-marker+is%3Aissue&type=issues)

### Also on my desk

Away from 3D I build a browser app for private investors in Germany: Monte-Carlo portfolio
projections and a German tax engine (FIFO per broker, Teilfreistellung, Vorabpauschale, loss-offset
pots). Different audience, so it lives elsewhere and is not linked here. Two pieces of it may show
up as their own repos: the broker import profiles and the tax engine.

### Writing up

Notes from the same work that aren't published yet. Ping me if one of these is what you were
searching for, that moves it up the list:

- **WebGPU runs in Tauri / WebView2 with no flags**, and gets 2 GiB buffers where ANGLE caps at 1.
- **A headless WebGPU test harness**: Edge headless + CDP, real GPU, screenshots, error counts.
  I couldn't find an existing one.
- **OIDN in a Tauri app**: the Rust side (crate pinned to a git rev, `bundled`) and the JS side.
